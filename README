INSTALL:
========

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building, and
does also have the necessary bits in place to do functional unit tests
using the varnishtest tool.

Usage:

./configure VARNISHSRC=DIR [VMODDIR=DIR]

VARNISHSRC is the directory of the Varnish source tree for which to
compile your vmod. Both the VARNISHSRC and VARNISHSRC/include
will be added to the include search paths for your module.

Optionally you can also set the vmod install directory by adding
VMODDIR=DIR (defaults to the pkg-config discovered directory from your
Varnish installation).

Make targets:

make - builds the vmod
make install - installs your vmod in VMODDIR

if VMODDIR is not on the user space do 'sudo make install' instead

In your VCL you could then use this vmod along the following lines:

import threescale;

sub vcl_hit {
	if (threescale.request_no_response("su1.3scale.net","80",req.url)==0) {}
}

It is recommended to use the configuration file provided in this
package on vcl/default_3scale_simple.vcl, 

sudo mv /etc/varnish/default.vcl /etc/varnish/default.vcl.bkp
sudo cp libmod-3scale/vcl/default_3scale_simple.vcl /etc/varnish/default.vcl
sudo /etc/init.d/varnish restart
 
It is always advisable to check the syslog for failures while testing

tail -f /var/log/syslog | egrep 'varnish'
